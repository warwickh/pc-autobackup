# PC AutoBackup for Linux and OS X for Samsung digital cameras #

This project has been forked from https://github.com/n-i-x/pc-autobackup and updated for python3. Python2 code is now in another branch.

I am currently running this as a docker container and I have included the Dockerfile and docker compose files.
